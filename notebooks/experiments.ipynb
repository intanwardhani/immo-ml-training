    "\n",
    "**1. Ridge Regression**\n",
    "* Ridge is still using the **log-transformed price** internally. On this scale, RMSE ≈ 0.291 corresponds roughly to a **29% relative error** in predicting house price.\n",
    "* Because of log-transform, the model predicts **multiplicative deviations** well but may underestimate large absolute errors on very expensive houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Business translation:\n",
    "* If the average house is €300k, expected prediction error ≈ €87k.\n",
    "* Ridge gives a *solid baseline* for linear relationships between features and price, but may miss nonlinear effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. RandomForest**\n",
    "* RandomForest is trained on **raw price**. Mean RMSE ≈ €173k, which is **quite large relative to median house prices** (likely due to skew in price distribution).\n",
    "* Large variation across folds (from ~€137k to ~€233k) indicates the model struggles with **heterogeneity in prices** (e.g., very high-end vs. mid-range properties).\n",
    "\n",
    "   Business translation:\n",
    "* Typical house price prediction error ≈ €173k, so the model might be reliable for *broad pricing ranges* but not for precise valuation.\n",
    "* Best for *flagging extreme under- or over-priced houses* rather than fine-grained pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. XGBoost**\n",
    "* XGBoost slightly improves over RandomForest (mean RMSE ≈ €167.5k).\n",
    "* This model captures **nonlinear interactions better**, but the RMSE is still large, which suggests that **current features alone aren’t enough** for high-precision predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Business translation:\n",
    "* Typical prediction error ≈ €167k for an average house.\n",
    "* Useful for **estimating price ranges** but not precise enough for exact listing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Key Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ridge** performs well in relative terms (log-scale), giving *stable predictions for multiplicative price changes*.\n",
    "2. **Tree models** (RF/XGBoost) perform similarly, slightly better with XGBoost, but absolute errors are high because prices are skewed.\n",
    "3. **High RMSE in absolute terms** indicates:\n",
    "   * Skewed price distribution (very high-end properties).\n",

    "1. Ridge: Predicts reasonably well, errors ~168k EUR. Reliable but may miss nonlinear patterns.\n",
    "2. RandomForest: Fits training data extremely well but fails on unseen data. Risky for real-world pricing.\n",
    "3. XGBoost: Balances bias/variance, slightly better generalisation than RandomForest. RMSE still ~175k EUR → on average ±175k EUR per prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "* For stable, interpretable predictions → **Ridge**.\n",
    "* For capturing complex patterns → **XGBoost**, possibly after hyperparameter tuning to reduce overfitting.\n",
    "* **RandomForest needs strong regularisation**; not ideal in current form.\n"
